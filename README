Hi,

You are to decode the text by cryptanalyzing the EP0 algorithm.
You are provided a code (ep0.c) implementing the algorithm along
with an encrypted text (2.txt). The algorithm is symmetric, which means the
same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the text.
The award is quite substancial and is clearly mentionned in the 
encrypted text.

Have fun, Jäsper
